            <h2>Midnight on Guard Duty</h2>
                <p>I am a security guard. Observe and report. 9 dollars hourly. 6 to 6 with half days on Friday morning.</p>
                <p>So that leads to a lot of musing time in between patrols. Yeah, I have a co-worker I can chat with when he drops in and he's good conversation but inbetween that is musing.</p>
                <p>Just thinking.</p>
                <p>That's how I came up with this website, honestly. I pounded out a good couple of hours trying to think of something to occupy my mind and I fell on working on a website. A host for projects and other things that caught my mind. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I admit to being a fan of <a href="stilldrinking.com">Still Drinking</a> for no more that his sense of humor and 'I cannot begin to give a single fuck' attitude despite our opposite ends of pretty much everything aside from maybe voting Democrat and I am not 100% on that one.</p>
                <p>Back to Security Guarding. After midnight, it gets quiet as fuck. Granted sometimes the geezers shuffle around like the Walking Dead but usually for the half shift, all is calm.</p>
                <p>So my mind wanders.</p>
                <p>and wanders</p>
                <p>and wanders farther and farther away...</p>
