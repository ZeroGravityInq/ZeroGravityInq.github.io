<h2>Starting over</h2>
    <p><i>It&rsquo;s been a long time, without you my friend</i></p>
    <p>I keep starting over and over, redesigns and ideas and the cycle is endless. So I am stopping tit. </p>
    <p>So this is Zero Gravity Inq</p>
    <p>I am not doing reviews. I will make content. There will be no ads. </p>
    <p>Just a white page and some words </p>
    <p>No pictures. </p>
    <p>Just thoughts. </p>
    <p>I have changed a lot since my last post. Had a job, lost a job, discovered another side of myself and gave up on people pushing me into corners I don&rsquo;t want to be in. I take less bullshit, am more honest and I haven&rsquo;t felt this free in a while. </p>
    <p>So here I am starting over. </p>
    <p>This will be my blog. Not Zero Gravity Inq - home of writing, technology and fandom though it does houses it. I haven&rsquo;t watched anime at all for most of last year. I am barely involved with a fandom of any kind as of late and my only technology is watching Let&rsquo;s Plays. </p>
    <p>There isn&rsquo;t Inq anymore. Just Starria. A woman with a blog, not niches or demographics, just a life that I want to log on the internet. </p>
    <p>So here we are. Starting again. </p>
    <p><i>And I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when I see you again...</i></p>
