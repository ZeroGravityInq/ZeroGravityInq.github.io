            <h1>About Me</h1>  
            <p>My name is Starria Turner, I am an Atlanta Native and still live there. I have interests all over the place like tech, writing, anime, makeup and whatever. I made this website to have a home for my writing and it's not organized in any kind of way.</p>
            <p>I coded this website myself by hand, line by line in Visual Studio Code and it's hosted on github pages so feel free to look through my code if you are feeling bored and want to loose a few more IQ points.</p>
            <p>Hit up the contact page if you want to, well, get in contact with me.</p>
