        <h2>Thoughts. Online.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Starting over
            <br>
            <i>It’s been a long time, without you my friend</i>
            <br>
            I keep starting over and over, redesigns and ideas and the cycle is endless. So I am stopping tit. 
            <br>
            So this is Zero Gravity Inq
            <br>
            I am not doing reviews. I will make content. There will be no ads. 
            <br>
            Just a white page and some words 
            <br>
            No pictures. 
            <br>
            Just thoughts. 
            <br>
            I have changed a lot since my last post. Had a job, lost a job, discovered another side of myself and gave up on people pushing me into corners I don’t want to be in. I take less bullshit, am more honest and I haven’t felt this free in a while. 
            <br>
            So here I am starting over. 
            <br>
            This will be my blog. Not Zero Gravity Inq home of writing, technology and fandom though it does houses it. I haven’t watched anime at all for most of last year. I am barely involved with a fandom of any kind as of late and my only technology is watching Let’s Plays. 
            <br>
            There isn’t Inq anymore. Just Starria. A woman with a blog, not niches or demographics, just a life that I want to log on the internet. 
            <br>
            So here we are. Starting again. 
            <br>
            And I’ll tell you all about it when I see you again...
